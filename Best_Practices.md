# Ways to make bike share programs more successful:

## Incentivize people to balance the network themselves

There are generally two ways that mobility share programs are run, docks and dockless. Docks are the places where you pick up the ride and leave it when you&#39;re done.

Use a combination of docked and dockless rides. If riders are incentivized to bring the rides back to the docks, this helps balance the network and keeps the rides charged and out of the way. When rides are left on the sidewalk, they can become a public nuisance and are at risk of theft or vandalism.

This &quot;gamified&quot; approach rewards riders who help balance the locations of the bikes.

## Maximize the productive use of the real estate

Add ancillary services at the docking stations such as mailboxes / retail delivery lockers, vending machines, wifi. Even the comfort provided by the shade of a solar canopy provides multiple benefits to the community.

## Add renewable energy to the docking stations

This shaded space can be used to charge the bikes and scooters as well as to project them from the elements if done using a solar canopy.

## Provide a variety of vehicle types

Include e-bikes and e-scooters

  1. E-bikes allow for greater distances to be travelled with ease and are arguably the future of two wheeled transit.
  2. Scooters balance out the options and are preferred by some people.
